### Background
<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/profile_pic.jpg" alt="Picture of William Huynh" width="600" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 10px" />
**William Huynh** is an undergraduate biochemistry student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
Currently, he is studying to become a dentist, and has shadowed [multiple dentists](https://wilhuy663.github.io/work/).
### His Name
William likes to go by **Thai** for a few reasons:
1. He dislikes being called Will, which people default to a lot
2. There are too many Williams, so this is a good way to set him apart from the many other Williams in his classes
